# MCPClient Python Application

This is a Python client application designed to interact with an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. 

## Features

- **Asynchronous Communication:** Uses `asyncio` for non-blocking communication between the client and server.
- **Customizable Server Scripts:** The client can connect to both Python and JavaScript-based server scripts.
- **Tool Management:** Dynamically fetches and interacts with tools available on the connected server.
- **Chat Interface:** Provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the server in a conversational format.
- **Tool Integration:** Supports extracting JSON-formatted tool calls from server responses and executing them.
- **Environment Variable Loading:** Supports loading environment variables from a `.env` file using the `dotenv` package.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `asyncio` library (included with Python)
- `requests` for HTTP requests to the server
- `mcp` (custom library for handling MCP communication)
- `dotenv` for environment variable management

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the script files) to your local machine.

2. **Install required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory to load necessary environment variables. For example:
    
    ```
    BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
    MODEL=llama3.2
    ```
    
2. **Run the client** with the path to the server script:
    
    ```bash
    python client.py <server_script_path>
    ```
    
    The server script can be a Python `.py` or JavaScript `.js` file.
    

## How It Works

1. **Connecting to the MCP Server:** The client connects to the server via standard input/output channels, using the provided script (`.py` or `.js`).
2. **Processing Queries:** The client sends user queries to the server and receives responses. Available tools are listed and can be called directly from the assistantâ€™s replies.
3. **Tool Execution:** If a response contains a valid tool call (in JSON format), the client extracts the call and triggers the respective tool on the server.
4. **Interaction:** The client interacts with the server in a conversational format, displaying results from server tools and continuing the conversation.

## Example Workflow

1. The user enters a query like:
    
    ```bash
    Question: What is the weather today?
    ```
    
2. The client sends the query to the server, which responds with available tools and information.
3. If the server suggests using a weather tool, the client executes the tool with the necessary parameters and shows the result.
4. The client continues the conversation based on the new information returned by the tool.
